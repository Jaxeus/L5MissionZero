# L5MissionZero
Mission Zero for Level 5 Advanced Software Developer

About the Project:
--> My massage therapist asked me to consider making her a website when she starts her own business, so I dabbled with this idea in this mission
--> I had made a basic website using Vanilla HTML and CSS in L4 but I started this project from scratch with React. The only things I used from previous work was the paragraphs in the "About-Section" and a few colors for fonts
--> I hardcoded everything from scratch using React and CSS Modules. I had started using a lot of viewport-width and viewport-height styling, but soon realised this isn't the best way, so I redid almost all of my sizing and made everything responsive (I tried to make it responsive for any typical sizes, not just typical mobile and laptop)
--> The most difficult part of the project for me, was the hamburger drop-down menu. I did achieve it with a useState, an onClick function, and using toggled classNames for the drop-down container so that when the hamburger icon (3 horiz. bars) was clicked, the drop-down menu that exists already (further back in z-index) is brought to the front and made visible.
--> I had hoped to create a database using MySWL and an API for the CardSection component, and had set the code up to support that using Props. However, due to time constraints as I am quite slow as a dev still, I didn't implement those.
--> I did attempt to use Bootstrap and TailWindCSS (there may be some unused dependencies in the package.json file, however, I struggled to comprehend the class about Bootstrap and TailwindCSS so I still don't understand how to use them and may need to watch some tutorials to get into that when I have more time.
--> I feel like my wesbite/application is quite basic, and not expertly designed, but I did grow in confidence a little with React and better understand some things that I was struggling to comprehend prior to this mission. I am glad to have a finished product, at least.
